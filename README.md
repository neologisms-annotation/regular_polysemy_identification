# regular_polysemy_identification
This repository contains all the data and analysis scripts related to the study named "Regular polysemy and novel word-sense identification". They are made public for the sake of transparency.

The repository contains the following files:

Preliminary experiment:
- preTest_analysis.R: the script used in the preliminary study to visualise the plausibility judgement data
- preTest_material.xlsx: the material used in the preliminary study
- preTest_raw_data_plausibility.txt: this file contains all the plausibility judgement data collected during the preliminary study, already sorted as to be opened in R
- preTest_raw_data_regularity.xlsx: this file contains the data about the experts' regularity assessment of our polysemy pattern: the first sheet contains the raw data, and the second contains the mean per pattern and figure
- preTest_results.xlsx: this file contains the average plausibility score (per word) and regularity (per pattern) assessed during the two online surveys. It is used to calculate a Pearson correlation in the preTest_analysis.R script
- preTest_survey_gr_a.docx: this file is a .docs transcription of the survey that the participants of the group A did for the plausibility judgement task
- preTest_survey_gr_b.docx: this file is a .docs transcription of the survey that the participants of the group B did for the plausibility judgement task

Main experiment:
- analysis_script.R: the script used in the study to analyse the measured variable
- exp_data.xlsx: this Excel file contains all the raw data collected during the experiment, already sorted as to be opened in R: the first sheet contains all the measures by stimulus, and the second contains the information by participant
- exp_data.txt: this file is the equivalent of the sheet 1 of the Excel file, i.e., the file for stimulus data, encoded in ANSI.
- exp_data_part.txt: this file is the equivalent of the sheet 2 of the Excel file, i.e., the file for participant data, encoded in ANSI.
- exp_material.xlsx: the material used in the experiment
