# regular_polysemy_identification
This repository contains all the data and analysis scripts related to the study named "Regular polysemy and novel word-sense identification". They are made public for the sake of transparency.

The repository contains the following files:
- analysis_script.R: the script used in the study to analyse the measured variable
- exp_data.xlsx: this Excel file contains all the raw data collected during the experiment, already sorted as to be opened in R. It contains two sheets, one for all the measures by stimulus, and one for information by participant
- exp_data.txt: this file is the equivalent of the sheet 1 of the Excel file, i.e., the file for stimulus data, encoded in ANSI.
- exp_data_part.txt: this file is the equivalent of the sheet 2 of the Excel file, i.e., the file for participant data, encoded in ANSI.

We also added two graphs that shows the partial effects of the models used in the main analyses.
- graph_pred_nov.png: shows the effect of novelty (novel vs. non-novel) on the identification of neologisms on all the data
- graph_pred_reg_fig.png: shows the effect of regularity (numeric) and figure (metaphor vs. metonymy) on the identification of neologism on only the stimuli containing a neologism
